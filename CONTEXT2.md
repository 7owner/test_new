# Project Context: projet_var_v4 (Session 2)

This document summarizes the work done and the current state of the `projet_var_v4` project since the creation of `CONTEXT.md`.

## Recent Work Completed:

### 1. Dashboard Enhancements
- **Chart.js Conflict Resolution**: The persistent Chart.js conflict in `dashboard.html` was addressed by removing the problematic `script.js` inclusion. All relevant dashboard functionalities (metrics, chart, urgent maintenances) are now handled by the inline script within `dashboard.html`.
- **Maintenance Links**: Added "Voir Maintenances" link to the "Maintenances actives" card and "Voir Agents" link to the "Agents actifs" card in `dashboard.html`.
- **Header Refinement**: Removed the horizontal navigation (`<nav>`) and the text title "üîß Syst√®me de Maintenance" from the header of all pages, ensuring comfortable spacing between the logo and the "Menu" button.

### 2. Maintenance Section Completion
- **`maintenances.html`**: Created the main list page for maintenances. Includes client-side seeded data, search and filter controls (by title/ID, status, and responsible), and action buttons (Voir, Modifier, Supprimer).
- **`maintenance-new.html`**: Created a form for creating new maintenances. Includes fields for `doe_id`, `affaire_id`, `titre`, `description`, `etat`, `responsable`, and a dynamic section for file uploads with comments.
- **`maintenance-view.html`**: Enhanced to display associated interventions. Each intervention entry shows description, dates, status, and includes "Voir" and "Modifier" buttons.
- **`maintenance-edit.html`**: Created a form for editing maintenance details, pre-filled with data based on URL parameter.

### 3. DOE Integration
- **`maintenance-new.html` & `maintenance-edit.html`**: Enhanced to display DOE details (title, description) and provide a clickable link to `doe-view.html` when a `doe_id` is selected.
- **`doe-view.html`**: Created to display details of a single DOE (`ID`, `Titre`, `Description`, `Site ID`, `Affaire ID`). Includes sections for associated documents and images with their comments, and action buttons.

### 4. Intervention Status & Rendu d'Intervention
- **`intervention` table (conceptual)**: Added a `status` field (enum: "pas commenc√©", "bloqu√©", "en attente", "en cours", "termin√©").
- **`interventions.html`**: Added a "Statut" column to the table and a dropdown filter for status.
- **`intervention-new.html` & `intervention-edit.html`**: Added a dropdown for `status` in the forms.
- **`intervention-view.html`**: Displays the `status` of the intervention. Also includes a new section "Rendus d'Intervention" with a list of associated reports, each with details, images, and action buttons. The "Ajouter un rendu" button now links to `rendu-intervention-new.html`.
- **`rendu-intervention-new.html`**: Created a form for creating new intervention reports, including fields for `resume`, `valeur`, and a dynamic section for uploading associated images with comments.
- **`rendu-intervention-view.html`**: Created to display details of a single `rendu_intervention`, including associated images.
- **`rendu-intervention-edit.html`**: Created a form for editing `rendu_intervention` details, pre-filled with data, and includes dynamic image upload/management.

### 5. `tables.txt` Update
- Updated `tables.txt` to reflect all new fields, enums, and tables introduced conceptually during the session (e.g., `site.ticket`, `site.responsable_matricule`, `intervention.status`, `rendu_intervention_image`).

## Current State & Important Notes:
- **Frontend Largely Complete**: The frontend UI for Agents, Interventions, Sites, Maintenances, DOEs, Passports, Formations, and Rendu d'Intervention is now largely complete, including forms, views, and list pages with filtering and dynamic content loading (client-side).
- **Client-Side Seeded Data**: All data displayed across the pages is client-side seeded for demonstration purposes. Actual data persistence and dynamic fetching from a real backend API are not yet implemented.
- **Backend Implementation Required**: The Node.js/Express.js backend needs to be developed to handle CRUD operations for all entities, manage file uploads (to `documents_repertoire`), and provide API endpoints for data interaction.
- **`logo_logicielle.png`**: The logo has been inserted into all relevant page headers. (Note: The actual image file needs to be present in the `public` directory for it to display).
- **Network Error**: A `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` error for `via.placeholder.com` was reported, which is an external network issue for placeholder images.

## Next Steps:
- Focus on backend development to implement API endpoints and database interactions for all frontend functionalities.
- Implement actual file upload handling and storage.
- Replace client-side seed data with calls to the backend API.
